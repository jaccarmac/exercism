# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```text
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."


## Hint
In Pharo, classes are objects that can have methods, however unlike HelloWorld the tests for TwoFer have been written to call instance methods.
