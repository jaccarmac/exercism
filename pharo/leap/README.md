# Leap

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does
this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Notes

Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to
learn!

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year
phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

## Hint
In Pharo, boolean operators are defined as messages. Study how "and:" and "or:" are implented in the classes True and False. Use the context menu item - senders of... to view how other parts of Pharo use these operators.


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `leap` into the `Exercism | Fetch Exercise` package menu prompt (right click on the Exercism package in the Pharo System Browser). You can also submit your solution from the same menu for any selected package. You don't normally need to use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `LeapTest`, will test the functionality of `Leap`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has more detailed help on [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).
